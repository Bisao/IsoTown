# Overview

This is a 2D isometric simulation game built with HTML5 Canvas where players can place houses, manage NPCs, and control game world interactions. The application features a grid-based isometric world with different types of buildings (farmer, lumberjack, miner houses) and autonomous or player-controlled NPCs. The game uses geometric shapes (squares for houses, circles for NPCs) and includes virtual joysticks for mobile control and pinch-to-zoom functionality for better view control.
